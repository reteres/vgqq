　　秋风，轻抚绿野山原，叶轻轻地漫舞，飘叶满天。萧索的秋风吹动沙沙的树叶，潺潺的溪水，和着婉转的鸟声，鸣奏着自然的乐曲。风卷着树上的黄叶，叶随风飘落在溪水里，溪载着叶一路欢歌流向小河。秋挺起成熟骄傲的身躯，到山脚、田野、山林、小溪、大海向夏挥手告别。树枝抖落着残叶，秋风掠过丛林，叶安然地飘落躺在了山野上、草丛里，在秋风的轻抚下甜甜地睡了。秋风抚过大地，大地一片金黄，似金、似银，如美丽的梦幻天堂。
	10、喜欢睡觉，因为那样我才有勇气在梦中拥抱你，拥抱不属于我的你。
　　我一个人躲在绿油油的高粱地里，那些高粱还刚刚长到和我一般的高度，我就穿行在它们中间追逐那些会飞的蚂蚱和蜻蜓。娘亲在不远的田垄里挥着锄头，豆子大小的汗珠正从她的鬓角落下来打在晚夏的叶子上，娘亲的身影在远处的画境里面，像是一朵美丽的云彩，飘忽的离不开我的视线，或者是我跑不出娘亲的关切的眼睛……
For Tibet, I have been with reverence and yearning.
The mystery of its beauty, its holy...
Good cold, pale, has always can't see the face, this also has always can't see their face.
Who also didn't open the closed door, no one to turn over, I don't expect partners, they also is nearby, I can find no way to change idea, they did not wear masks in existence, and really want to cry, really want to have a spiritual harbor might as well have a rest, I let go.
